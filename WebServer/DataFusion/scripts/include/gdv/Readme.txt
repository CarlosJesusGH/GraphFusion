Scripts to use the graphlet counter, orca, on our networks.

All networks need to be in the same folder, e.g., "Networks".
Running the python script count_all.py on this folder, e.g., "python count_all.py ./Networks/", will compute the GDV signatures of nodes for all networks in the folder.

In folder GDVs, we provide the GDV signatures used in our cancer-specific study.
