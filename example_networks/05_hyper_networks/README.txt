In each hypernetwork file, each row corresponds to an hyperedge. 

The first element of a row denotes the index of the associated hyperedge (between 0 and m-1, where m denotes the number of hyperedge). The other elements corresponds to an id assigned to each gene (between 0 and n-1, n being the total number of genes). 

The .id2gene file associated to each .hypergraph file contains the mapping from our id index to Entrez IDs.
